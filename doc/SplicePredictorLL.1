.SH DESCRIPTION
The basic version of \fISplicePredictorLL\fP implements logitlinear models for
splice site prediction trained on reliable sets of maize and \fIArabidopsis
thaliana\fP genomic sequences as described in Reference 1.
The predictions are based on the two variables of (i) degree of matching to
the splice site consensus and (ii) local compositional contrast.
The models assign a \fIP-value\fP between 0 and 1 to each potential splice site
such that true sites mostly score high and non-sites mostly score low.
The \fIP-value\fPs represent intrinsic splice site quality.
In otherwise constant context, sites with increased \fIP-value\fP are predicted
to result in more efficient splicing (see Reference 2).
Improvements to the basic model include the context-dependent scores \fIrho\fP
and \fIgamma\fP (Reference 3).
The \fIrho-value\fP of a given site is calculated as a weighted product of its
P-value times the P-value of its best potential intron-forming complementary
splice site; 0 < \fIrho\fP < 1.
The \fIgamma-value\fP of a site reflects how well this site fits in the locally
predicted splicing pattern.
If the given site is in a context that suggests preferred usage of nearby sites
as splicing partners to the exclusion of the given site, its \fIgamma-value\fP
will be zero.
Otherwise it will be a positive value less or equal to 2; high values of
\fIgamma\fP would strongly suggest actual usage of the site.

To quickly assess the overall quality of a site we implemented a * grading
system: the values of \fIP\fP, \fIrho\fP, and \fIgamma\fP are labeled 5*,
4*, 3*, or 2* if they match or exceed the threshold values for 90%, 80%,
65%, and 50% prediction specificity on the training set, 1* otherwise.
The sum of the \fI*-values\fP (attaining values between 3* and 15*) serves as a
simple combined measure.
For example, sites scoring 14* or 15* are highly reliable (estimated
specificity > 90%).

Minimal input to the program consists of a genomic sequence for which potential
splice sites are to be listed.
Optionally, the user may also supply cDNA/ESTs or "target proteins" which are
known or suspected to significantly match the genomic sequence or its
translation into encoded amino acids chains.
If supplied, the algorithm will return optimal \fIspliced alignments\fP which
"thread" the targets into the genomic DNA by scoring for splice sites and
sequence similarity in potential exons while allowing for introns as long gaps
in the alignment (References 4 and 5).

.SH USAGE
\&
.SH "Input file format"
.PP
\fBGenomic DNA input:\fP
Sequences should be in the one-letter-code
({a,b,c,d,g,h,i,k,m,n,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,y}),
upper or lower case; all other characters are ignored during input.
Multiple sequence input is accepted in \fIlibrary (FASTA) file format\fP
or in \fIGenBank format\fP.

\fILibrary (FASTA) file format\fP
refers to raw sequence data separated by identifier lines of the form starting
with ">" followed by the sequence name.
For options \fB-e\fP, \fB-E\fP, \fB-q\fP, and \fB-l\fP, the name of the
sequence is taken to be the first string on the ">" line delimited by space,
tab, |, or : starting from position 5.
For example, ">gi|idnumber|something-else" is given the name "idnumber".
For options \fB-Q\fP and \fB-L\fP, the name of the
sequence is taken to be the first string on the ">" line delimited by space,
tab, |, or : starting from position 2.
In the above example, the name would be "gi".
Typically, this option is appropriate for sequences supplied by the user in the
format ">my-sequence-name comments".

Examples (\fB-e\fP, \fB-E\fP, \fB-q\fP, and \fB-l\fP options):
 
.Ex

.Xe

.PP
\fIGenBank format\fP
refers to raw sequence data with possible annotations as in standard GenBank
files.
Minimal requirements are the LOCUS and ORIGIN lines.
Multiple sequences must be separated by // lines.

.PP
\fBEST sequence input:\fP
EST sequences for spliced alignment may be supplied as a sequence file in
library format with the \fI-eE estdbn\fP options.  Spliced alignment will only
be performed for genomic DNA sequences of lengths not exceeding the parameter
MAXGLGTH (default: 13000).

.PP
\fBQuery protein input:\fP
Query protein sequences for spliced alignment may be supplied with the
\fI-qQ qpfname\fP option, where \fIqpfname\fP is a sequence file in library
format. Spliced alignment will only be performed for genomic DNA sequences of
lengths not exceeding the parameter MAXGLGTH (default: 13000).


.SH "Parameters"
.PP
There always is a trade-off between \fIsensitivity\fP ("How many true sites
will be correctly predicted?") versus \fIspecificity\fP ("How large is the
number of presumably false positive predictions?"). Four settings are optional:
"all GU and AG sites" prints out the donor and acceptor model scores at each GU
or AG, respectively, in the sequence; "100% learning set" (default) sets the
printing threshold at a level that includes all sites that were in our learning
sets; "95% learning set" sets the printing threshold at a level that includes
95% of the sites that were in our learning sets; "maximal tau" represents the
best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.



.SH "Output format"
.PP
Output is directed to standard output.

\fBSpliced alignment:\fP
For each significantly matching EST, the predicted gene structure based on an
optimal spliced alignment is displayed.
The upper line gives the genomic DNA and the lower line gives the EST
sequence.
Identities are indicated by vertical bars in the center line.
Introns are indicated by dots, gaps in the exons by '_'.
For protein spliced alignments, the alignment gives the genomic DNA sequence,
its inferred protein translation (one-letter-code), and the matching parts of
the target protein sequence.
Identical residues are linked by "|", positively scoring substitutions by
"+", and zero scoring substitutions by "." according to the
amino acid substitution scoring matrix used in the alignment.
Coordinates for the predicted exons and introns are given in the list
preceding the alignment.
Exons are assigned a normalized similarity score (1.000 represents 100%
identity).
For introns, the list gives the P-values of the donor and acceptor sites
(Reference 4) as well as a similarity score (s) based on the sequence
similarity in the adjacent 50 bases of exon.
