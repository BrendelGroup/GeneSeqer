If you use LaTex, you can produce simple pictures depicting splice site
location and strength directly from SplicePredictor output.  Use the "xmkfig"
script in this directory to produce inserts for fig.tex, process fig.tex,
and look at the PostScript output. The command reproduces the features of
Fig.2 and Fig.3 of Brendel & Kleffe (1998) Nucl. Acids Res. 26, 4748-4757.


Notes:

xmkfig.alt uses 'echo "\\ ..."' to produce a single backslash in fig.ins -
	this seems to be necessary for older versions of glibc.

At least for Linux, ggv default shows the pictures upside down. Use
"Swap Landscape" to show the pictures correctly.  If somebody knows how to fix
this more elegantly, please let me know!
