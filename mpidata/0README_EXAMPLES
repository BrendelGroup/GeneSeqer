GeneSeqer-MPI - README_EXAMPLES                               (January 24, 2022)
________________________________________________________________________________

I. Set the number of processors (x) in the lines

set np = x

in x*.


II. Example:

(You can omit the MakeArray associated lines in xrunme if you have already
 generated the indices for ATest1 and ATest2 in ../data in a previous step.)

xrunme

  should produce out.gbA, the single processor output as in ../data, and
  out.gbA.MPIx, the output produced by the MPI version with x processors.

xdiff

  will show the differences between your output files and the supplied
  originals.  When comparing out.gbA with out.gbA.MPIx, EST sequence numbers
  could change, but otherwise the output should be identical.


NOTES:

(1) To evaluate performance of the code, you could produce the binary "GeneSeqerMPIt"
    with "make -f makefile.lnxMPIt" in ../src and then issue
    	xrunme >& err.sh.o
    Peruse "xtimes" and execute this script to generate a record of time points
    in the GeneSeqerMPI run.

(2) The directory HPCsubmit-scripts contains a few submit scripts on various
    HPC resources that use job schedulers.  You will need to make adjustments
    for the resource you are using according to their instructions, but these
    template scripts might give you a useful starting point.
